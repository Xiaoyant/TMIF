./data/OFG2/predict_img/Alpinoschwagerina_rotundata_001.jpg|Shell medium to large,inflated fusiform to subspherical with slightly concave lateral slopes and bluntly pointed poles.The initial three or four whorls tightly coil,elongate fusiform or fusiform in shape,and outer whorls loosen sharply,inflated fusiform.Spirotheca rather thin in inner whorls,thick in outer two whorls.Septa flute irregularly in outer whorls and flutings broad and irregular semicircular.Chomata small,distinct in the innermost three or four whorls.Proloculus small.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Biwaella_provecta_002.jpg|Shell small,oval.Initially very tightly coiled,septal folds,outer whorl relaxed,septal folds right only,folds higher,irregularly arranged,distinct undulating folds.Spinning ridges small,seen only in inner whorl.Passage narrow,primary chamber small.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Boultonia_willsi_001.jpg|Shell minute,long fusiform,slightly arched at the middle,sharply pointed at both poles.The envelope is tightly coiled,and the central axis of one or two inner whorls is orthogonal or oblique to that of the outer whorl.Spin wall thin,composed of dense layer and transparent layer.The transparent layer is more clearly broken.The septal folds are stronger,with low folds and more regular arrangement.Spin ridges are small and present in each whorl.Channels low and wide,with slight axial accumulation and tiny primordial chambers.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Eofusulina_triangula_003.jpg|The shape of Shell generally triangular,and the rotating wall consists of a primitive layer with small pores and a strong next door fold.Folds The shape of the folds is not very regular,and the primary chamber is generally large.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Fusiella_typica_003.jpg|Shell small,fusiform,strongly arched in the middle,sharply pointed at both poles.Five to the whorls,initially one or two whorls in an endocoelomorphic envelope,whose central axis intersects the central axis of the outer whorl The shell whorls are tightly coiled.Shell whorls tightly coiled.Spinning wall thin,composed of dense layers and inner and outer lax layers.The spiral wall is thin and consists of three layers: dense layer and inner and outer loose layers.The septum is straight.Spinning ridges are not large,but very clear,showing two small black dots in the axial section.The channel is low and wider.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Hemifusulina_elliptica_001.jpg|Subellipsoid,flat or slightly arched in the center,two layers of the rotary wall,the honeycomb layer is very thin,the next door is folded only in the lower part,the rotary ridge is not very big,and the channel is low and wide; locality: Jiangyou,Sichuan Province; stratigraphy: Carboniferous Moscovite Stage.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Millerella_minuta_001.jpg|Flat and rounded,with an inner whorl of internal rotation and an outer whorl of external rotation,with low and narrow spinning ridges and channels.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Verella_prolixa_003.jpg|Shell small,long fusiform,slightly arched in the middle,bluntly pointed at both poles.Three whorls,the first whorl is fusiform.Spinous wall consists of three layers: dense and inner and outer sparse layers.The septum is straight in the inner two whorls,and a broadly rounded folded septum is visible in the outermost half whorl.Spinning ridges are prominent.The channel is wide.Axial deposits are developed,distributed along the central axis and extending to the pole.Primary chambers large.
./data/OFG2/predict_img/Zellia_magnae-sphaerae_002.jpg|Shell medium,suhspherical or spherical with slightly concave umbilicus parts.The initial two whorls tightly coil,fusiform,while outer whorls rapidly inflate to subspherical or spherical Spirotheca thin in inner whorls,and gradually increase in thickness outwards.Septa straight.Chomata low but distinct in all whorls or just inner whorls.Proloculus small and spherical.
