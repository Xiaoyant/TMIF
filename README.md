Instruction guide:

The train.py file is used to train the model, and predict.py is used to make predictions on the test set. To download the training model click https://pan.baidu.com/s/16-hUw3IMuOb0gf0dr9AuQg?pwd=3f74. The extraction code is 3f74. Download the weights file and place it in the /runs/weights folder. Predictions can be made by running the predict.py file directly after deploying the environment according to the requirements.txt file.
